<h2>Iâ€™ll be writing down some features, ideas, and important things to add to the project on this page.</h2>

<h3>Where to integrate, what to integrate, when to integrate, we'll see later, ill just write it down here for future use. 
    Even you guys can write below if you have anything.
</h3>
<h4>
1) Make sure to add a dropdown that classifies drugs by medical specialty (e.g., general medicine, orthopedics, neurology, etc.).

2) Make sure to add a models dropdown, where users can select from a list of available models.
   
3) We will focus on a general approach for the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) checker, where the platform is accessible to everyone, rather than having separate pages for doctors and patients.
   This is because, at this stage, we aren't aiming to make the project industry-ready with complex features, such as EHR integrations or professional user management.
   The idea is to build a solid foundation that can be expanded in the future by others who may want to take it to an industry level.
   If the project grows, future developers could integrate advanced features like doctor-specific roles or connect the platform with EHRs.
   For now, anyone can use the website, which makes it more versatile and simple to manage.
   (basically who ever login's is a patient or is a person trying to enter a patient detials)

5) Add a section that provides drug information and details.

6) page to store patient details or upload patient data or some file type. (they can choose either of the options, and our gpt will autofill and look for what's missing.

7) may be we need to look into clinical guidelines and stuff, but i hope for this project that high level stuff wont be necessary (i hope so).

8) keeping track of DDI interactions (maintaining history) (a feature which most of the pages dont have it i guess or may be they have integrated in premium version)

9) Drug dosage information, as you guys suggested. (but need to find dataset for this.)

10) search should be in a way that they should be able to filter (find drug by some specific class, or name or ingredient, etc)

11) information section where how this application also can be used to integrate with the EHR's and stuff and other informations about how benifical this project is. (like an about section)

12) most importantly, adding a feedback mechanism, (user feedback) as well as (feedbacks from people on what was the reaction when they took those drugs or something like that.)

<h2> Current Structure of the project</h2>
<h3>1) landing page (should have some details about the project, and login sign up part and a try now button which will make the ddi demo appear on the same screen so that people can test.

2) login signup page, just integrate with google authentication (straight away sign up with google), lets not work much on that.

####################=> once the above 2 are ready we will discuss further.

3)

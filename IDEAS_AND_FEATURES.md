# 🌟 Project Features and Ideas

### ✍️ Where to integrate, what to integrate, and when to integrate will be decided later.  
For now, I’ll just write down ideas here for future reference.  
💡 *Feel free to add anything below if you have suggestions!*

---

## 🎯 Features
1. 📋 **Drug Classification Dropdown**  
   Add a dropdown that classifies drugs by medical specialty (e.g., General Medicine, Orthopedics, Neurology, etc.).

2. 🧠 **Models Dropdown**  
   Add a dropdown where users can select from a list of available models.

3. 🌍 **General Approach for the DDI Checker**  
   - The platform should be accessible to everyone without separate pages for doctors or patients.  
   - Build a strong foundation that others can expand into industry-level applications in the future.  
   - Advanced features like doctor-specific roles or EHR integration can be added later by developers.  
   - For now, all users (patients or general users) will have the same access.

4. 🔍 **Drug Information Section**  
   Add a section that provides comprehensive drug information and details.

5. 📂 **Patient Data Storage**  
   Create a page to store patient details or upload patient data files.  
   - Users can choose either option, and the system will autofill fields while checking for missing data.

6. 📜 **Clinical Guidelines (Optional)**  
   Explore clinical guidelines and standards if needed (likely not required at this stage).

7. 🕒 **DDI Interaction History**  
   Track and maintain a history of drug interactions.  
   *(This feature may not be available on many platforms or might be part of their premium plans.)*

8. 💊 **Drug Dosage Information**  
   Include dosage details, provided a suitable dataset is available.

9. 🔎 **Advanced Search**  
   Enable users to filter drugs by specific class, name, ingredient, etc.

10. 📖 **Informational Section**  
    Add a section about how this application can integrate with EHR systems and highlight the benefits of the project (like an "About" section).

11. 🗨️ **Feedback Mechanism**  
    - Collect general user feedback.  
    - Include user-reported reactions and experiences with certain drugs.
